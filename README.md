### Hi, I'm Richi ðŸ‘‹

<img align="right" src="https://richi.codes/richicodes_logo.png" alt="richi gallego logo - software developer, web developer, Barcelona, share code tips, front end developer">

More than 10 years and a lot of websites developed, such as corporate sites, online stores, digital advertising, static sites, dynamic sites, etc. During that time, I have had the pleasure of working with many advertising agencies, consulting firms and design studios, as well as dozens of local companies and individuals.

I have high knowledge and professional experience both as a Front-End programmer with languages, libraries or frameworks such as Vue, React, HTML, CSS, SASS and as a Back-End programmer with PHP, SQL or NoSQL databases such as MySQL or Firebase Realtime-Database. I also work with CMS like Wordpress or Prestashop developing modules, plugins or templates. And also I have the ability to create Skills for Amazon Alexa.

We know that this world is updated daily. So every day I keep learning new technologies, new concepts as fast as possible, adapting to changes and everything related to online development or project needs.

I love design and I like beautiful things so I work very well with designers too and I am very perfectionist when following the design, "pixel-perfect".

Contact me if you want to make your idea come true, if you want me to solve any problem you have in your web or just to say hello!
